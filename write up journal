Experiment No. 2
Aim:
To study and implement C++ program structure and understand the use of various data types.

Tools Required:
Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

C++ Compiler (MinGW-w64 via MSYS2)

Terminal / Command Prompt for compilation and execution

Theory:
In C++, data types are used to define the type of data a variable can hold. The fundamental data types include:

int – integer values (e.g., 1, -5)

float – floating point numbers (e.g., 3.14)

double – double-precision floating point numbers

char – single character (e.g., 'a', 'Z')

bool – boolean values (true or false)

string – sequence of characters (not a primitive type but commonly used via <string> library)

A typical C++ program includes:

Preprocessor directives like #include<iostream>

using namespace std; to use standard functions like cout and cin

main() function as the entry point

Input (cin) and output (cout) streams

The sizeof() operator is used to determine the size (in bytes) of a data type or variable.

Example code includes:

Accepting input from the user for various data types

Printing the values and their sizes

Conclusion:
Through this experiment:

You learned the structure of a C++ program, including header files and the main function.

You understood different built-in data types in C++.

You were able to take user input, store it in appropriate variables, and determine their memory sizes using the sizeof() operator.
